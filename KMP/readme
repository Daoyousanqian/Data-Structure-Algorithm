Here is the KMP algorithm that I changed. 
The pros of KMP is that the effeciency is much higher than the comparison one by one.
in this algorithm all the pointer on the main string is never back off.

The first step is to compute the "next" array.
the method is: find the maximum public substring

During the comparison the pointer on the son_string will be back off following the next array.

Great algorithm.
